The project was implemented during Javascript training by 
**Olek Kalashnyk**

-------------------------------
### Task:
Create a program that implements character output as a string, where the number of characters will be the input number.

#### How it works:
Example # 1:
```javascript
Input: 5
Output: 

"A B C"
" Z Y"
"A B"
" Z"
"A"
" Z"
"A B"
" Z Y"
"A B C"
```
Example # 2:
```javascript
Input: 7
Output: 
"A B C D"

" Z Y X"

"A B C"

" Z Y"

"A B"

" Z"

"A"

" Z"

"A B"

" Z Y"

"A B C"

" Z Y X"

"A B C D"
```

------------------------------

### The requirement to execute:
###### The program must accept numbers from 1 to 17.
###### Output to the browser (in any form).
